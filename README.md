An interactive app designed for OSC OnDemand that launches an RStudio Server
within an Owens batch job.

## Prerequisites

This Batch Connect app requires the following software be installed on the
**compute nodes** that the batch job is intended to run on (**NOT** the
OnDemand node):

- [Lmod] 6.0.1+ or any other `module restore` and `module load <modules>` based
  CLI used to load appropriate environments within the batch job before
  launching the RStudio Server.

**without Singularity**

- [R] 3.3.2+ (earlier versions are untested but may work for you)
- [RStudio Server] 1.0.136+ (earlier versions are untested by may work for you)
- [PRoot] 5.1.0+ (used to setup fake bind mount)

**or with Singularity**

- [Singularity] 2.4.2+
- A Singularity image similar to [nickjer/singularity-rstudio]
- Corresponding module to launch the above Singularity image (see
  [example_module])

## Install

Use git to clone this app and checkout the desired branch/version you want to
use:

```sh
scl enable git19 -- git clone <repo>
cd <dir>
scl enable git19 -- git checkout <tag/branch>
```

You will not need to do anything beyond this as all necessary assets are
installed. You will also not need to restart this app as it isn't a Passenger
app.

To update the app you would:

```sh
cd <dir>
scl enable git19 -- git fetch
scl enable git19 -- git checkout <tag/branch>
```

Again, you do not need to restart the app as it isn't a Passenger app.
